    This first alpha release is still highly experimental and won't run most applications.
    Features:
    - Running x86 and x86_64 applications on arm64
    - That happens automagically when qemu is at C:\x86\qemu-x86_64.exe.so
    - Android support (currently first starts native cmd, then x86_64 notepad++), prebuilt apk attached...
    - D3D support (not on Android, because Wine cannot fully deal with GLES yet)
