/* NOTE: The guest side uses mingw's headers. The host side uses Wine's headers.
 *
 * Wrapping msvcrt like this is not my first choice. In theory it only calls Windows
 * API functions and has a lot of small functions, so running it as a Win32/64 DLL
 * would save a lot of work and would most likely be faster and more compatible. Keep
 * in mind that CRT code is embedded into every crt-linked binary. Things will go
 * wrong if the host-side msvcrt.dll tries to access the module image - and it seems
 * the code in dlls/msvcrt/cpp.c is doing just that.
 *
 * Unfortunately Wine's msvcrt is not stand-alone and imports symbols from Linux/OSX
 * libc. So it is disabled in a mingw cross compile build, and if it is forced on it
 * will link against itself...
