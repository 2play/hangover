 * There are a few options around this for this particular data structure. The best seems
 * to reimplement them ourselves instead of calling Wine and using the LockSemaphore
 * entry to store a pointer or handle to a Win64 sync object. Because we need to limit
 * the address space anyway we can fit this pointer into the 32 bit HANDLE. */
